# Problem 1

1. Show that $A^T A \neq AA^T$ in general. (Proof and demonstration.)
2. For a special type of square matrix A, we get $A^T A \neq AA^T$ . Under what conditions could this be true? (Hint: The Identity matrix I is an example of such a matrix).

Please typeset your response using LaTeX mode in RStudio.

# Problem 2

Matrix factorization is a very important problem. There are supercomputers built just to do matrix factorizations. Every second you are on an airplane, matrices are being factorized. Radars that track flights use a technique called Kalman filtering. At the heart of Kalman Filtering is a Matrix Factorization operation. Kalman Filters are solving linear systems of equations when they track your flight using radars.

Write an R function to factorize a square matrix A into LU or LDU, whichever you prefer. You don't have to worry about permuting rows of A and you can assume that A is less than 5x5, if you need to hard-code any variables in your code.
