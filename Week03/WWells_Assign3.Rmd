# Problem 1

(1) What is the rank of the matrix A?
(2) Given an mxn matrix where m > n, what can be the maximum rank? The minimum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?
(3) What is the rank of matrix B?

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,
              -1,0,1,3,
              0,1,-2,1,
              5,4,-2,-3), 4, byrow=T)

B <- matrix(c(1,2,1,
              3,6,3,
              2,4,2), 3, byrow=T)
```

# Problem 2

Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A. You'll need to show your work. You'll need to write out the characteristic polynomial and show your solution.

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,3,
              0,4,5,
              0,0,6), 3, byrow=T)
```
